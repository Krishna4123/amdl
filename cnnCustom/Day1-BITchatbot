🔹 Overview of BIT Official Chatbot

The Bannari Amman Institute of Technology chatbot is a **rule-based and NLP-assisted conversational system** that provides information related to:

* Admissions
* Courses & departments
* Campus facilities
* Placements
* Contact details
* Academic policies
* Events and announcements

It is typically embedded into the **official BIT website** and designed for **quick, structured responses** rather than open-ended conversations.

🔧 Technologies Used (Inferred & Industry-Standard)

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The chatbot uses **basic NLP techniques** to understand user queries, such as:

* Tokenization
* Keyword extraction
* Intent matching

This allows it to map user questions like:

> “What courses are offered?”
> to predefined intents like:
> `COURSE_INFORMATION`

🔹 Likely tools:

* Python NLP libraries (NLTK / spaCy)
* JavaScript-based NLP (for frontend handling)
* Dialogflow-style intent classification (or similar)

Rule-Based / Intent-Driven System

Unlike generative AI models (ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.), the BIT chatbot primarily operates on:

* **Predefined question–answer pairs**
* **Decision trees**
* **Keyword-based routing**

This ensures:
✅ Accuracy
✅ Institutional control
✅ Safe and reliable answers

---

Backend Framework

The backend is typically implemented using:

* Python (Flask/Django) or
* Node.js

The backend:

* Receives user input
* Matches intent
* Fetches response from a structured database or JSON file
* Sends reply to frontend

---

Database / Knowledge Base

The chatbot pulls responses from a **static or semi-dynamic knowledge base**, which may include:

* MySQL / PostgreSQL
* JSON / XML files
* CMS-linked institutional data

This database contains:

* Department details
* Admission rules
* Placement statistics
* Faculty contacts

---
Web Integration (Frontend)

The chatbot interface is built using:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

It is often implemented as:

* A floating chat widget
* A modal window on the BIT website

---

Hosting & Deployment

The chatbot is likely:

* Hosted on BIT’s internal servers or cloud infrastructure
* Integrated securely within the institute’s official domain
* Designed for **high availability and low latency**

---

What the BIT Chatbot Does NOT Use

Based on its behavior, the chatbot does **not** appear to use:

* Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT
* Deep learning Transformer architectures
* Generative text models

This is intentional, to ensure:

* Institutional reliability
* No hallucinated answers
* Controlled information dissemination
